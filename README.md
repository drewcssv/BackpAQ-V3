Welcome to the Repo for BackpAQ V3 Air Quality monitor. 

BackpAQ is a versatile, portable system designed to enable teachers and students to accurately measure, record and visualize air quality inside, outside and anywhere in the community. It consists of low-cost handheld devices that sense, display and transmit data from a set of sensors to a cloud-based dashboard. A companion app runs on a smartphone which is paired with the device and provides a detailed real-time view of various sensor readings using gauges, graphs and geo-based mapping.

The dashboard, AQView, provides a comprehensive set of data visualization, charting, graphing, reporting and export capabilities. 

All sensor data is available on the BackpAQ AQView website.
